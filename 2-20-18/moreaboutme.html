  <!-- A section that describes more about me -->
  <p>Some of my favorite meals to cook includes pasta
    and chicken dishes. I love to cook for my
    roommates and parents.    <br /> <br />

  	When I'm not cooking, I'm most likley listening to music.
    I don't really listen to a specific genre or artist,
    just whatver comes up on the radio or spotify!<br /> <br />

    Me and my friends are always watching movies. Some
    of my favorites are classic Disney, horror films,
    and comedies!
